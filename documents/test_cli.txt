Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning Revolution

Artificial intelligence has transformed the technology landscape in unprecedented ways. Machine learning algorithms now power recommendation systems, natural language processing applications, and computer vision tasks across industries.

Deep learning, a subset of machine learning, uses neural networks with multiple layers to extract hierarchical features from data. Convolutional neural networks excel at image recognition, while recurrent neural networks handle sequential data processing effectively.

The transformer architecture revolutionized natural language processing. Models like GPT and BERT demonstrate remarkable performance in text generation, sentiment analysis, and question answering tasks.
