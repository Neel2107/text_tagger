Authentication Guide

Authentication verifies user identity in applications. Common methods include:

OAuth 2.0: Industry standard for authorization
- Authorization Code Flow: Most secure for web apps
- Client Credentials: For machine-to-machine auth
- Implicit Flow: Deprecated for security reasons

JWT (JSON Web Tokens): Compact token format for secure data transmission
- Header: Algorithm and token type
- Payload: User claims and data
- Signature: Verification hash

Best practices:
- Always use HTTPS
- Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
- Use secure password hashing (bcrypt, Argon2)
- Set proper session timeouts
- Never store sensitive tokens in localStorage
