Machine Learning Guide

Machine learning is a method of teaching computers to learn from data. It involves training algorithms on datasets to recognize patterns and make predictions.

Key Concepts:
- Supervised Learning: Training with labeled data (classification, regression)
- Unsupervised Learning: Finding patterns in unlabeled data (clustering)
- Neural Networks: Deep learning models inspired by the brain
- Random Forests: Ensemble method using multiple decision trees
- Model Training: Process of fitting algorithms to data
- Cross-Validation: Technique to prevent overfitting

Common metrics include accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
